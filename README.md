# My portfolio website
Portfolio Website
This is a simple portfolio website that I created using HTML and basic CSS. It consists of two pages: the home page and the contact page.

# Features
# Home Page:
The home page serves as an introduction, providing a brief overview of who I am and what I do. It may include a welcome message, a summary of my skills and expertise, and a showcase of selected projects.
# Contact Page:
The contact page allows visitors to get in touch with me easily. It typically includes a contact form or my contact details, such as email address or social media links.
Technologies Used
# HTML5: Used for structuring the content of both the home and contact pages.
# CSS3: Used for styling and layout.
